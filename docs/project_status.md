Completion report: `docs/completions/pla_1_cost-element-schedule-tab-migration-completion.md`.

- **2025-11-12:** ✅ **Cost Element Schedule Documentation Refined.** Updated PRD, data model, and roadmap language to document schedule registration description/registration date requirements, newest-registration selection for live EVM, and baseline cloning rules ahead of implementation phase.

- **2025-11-10:** ✅ **E4-001 PLANNED VALUE ENGINE COMPLETE!** Added PV calculation service and `/projects/{project_id}/planned-value` APIs, persisted `planned_value` snapshots via migration `2f8c2a1ad8e3_add_planned_value_to_baseline_cost_element.py`, regenerated the SDK/UI to surface PV metrics, and verified `python -m pytest backend/tests/services/test_planned_value.py backend/tests/api/routes/test_planned_value.py` passes against local Postgres (`postgres/changethis@localhost:5432/app`).
- **2025-11-09:** ✅ **E3-007 BASELINE DECOUPLING COMPLETE!** Earned value entries no longer persist `baseline_id`; BaselineCostElement snapshots now capture both `percent_complete` and `earned_ev`, and baseline earned value UI reflects snapshot data. Backend migration `0f5f73e9f9ad_decouple_earned_value_baseline` deployed with regenerated API client and updated documentation.
- **2025-11-07:** ✅ **PLA-1 CODE CLEANUP COMPLETE!** Removed deprecated BaselineSnapshot model and dropped the table via migration `a8d41cd1b784_remove_baseline_snapshot_table`. Updated helper/tests to rely exclusively on `BaselineLog` and retained `BaselineSnapshotSummaryPublic` as a backwards-compatible alias. Next step: manual UI verification for baseline creation/summaries.
- **2025-11-07:** ✅ **E3-006 IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE!** Added backend `earned_value_entries` CRUD routes with schedule validation, percent range enforcement, duplicate date protection, and earned value derivation. Regenerated OpenAPI client and implemented Earned Value tab with add/edit/delete dialogs (percent preview, warning surfacing) on the cost element detail page. All 11 backend API tests, targeted Vitest spec, and TypeScript build passing.
- **2025-01-27:** ✅ **PLA-1 IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE!** Baseline Log and Baseline Snapshot merge fully implemented. All 8 phases complete: Model updates (department/is_pmb fields added to BaselineLog), database migration (columns added + data migrated), helper function refactoring (create_baseline_cost_elements_for_baseline_log replaces create_baseline_snapshot_for_baseline_log), API endpoint updates (use BaselineLog directly, snapshot endpoint works without BaselineSnapshot), frontend component updates (ViewBaselineSnapshot → ViewBaseline, BaselineSnapshotSummary → BaselineSummary), API client regeneration (types updated), test updates (all route tests updated, verify BaselineSnapshot NOT created), deprecation (BaselineSnapshot marked as deprecated with TODO comments). **Result:** Unified baseline management system using BaselineLog only. BaselineSnapshot model kept for backward compatibility but marked deprecated. All tests passing, no regressions. Backward compatibility maintained (snapshot_id = baseline_id in API responses).
- **2025-11-05:** 📋 **PLA-1 DETAILED PLAN COMPLETE!** Baseline Log and Baseline Snapshot merge detailed TDD implementation plan created at `docs/plans/pla_1_baseline-log-snapshot-merge-implementation.plan.md`. Plan includes 8 phases: Model updates (add department/is_pmb fields), database migration (add columns + data migration), helper function refactoring (remove BaselineSnapshot creation), API endpoint updates (use BaselineLog directly), frontend component updates (rename components, update props), API client regeneration, test updates and cleanup, deprecation (optional). Follows TDD approach with failing tests first, incremental commits (<100 lines, <5 files), and comprehensive test coverage. Estimated effort: 12-16 hours total (backend 8-10h, frontend 2-3h, testing 2-3h). Ready for implementation starting Phase 1 (TDD: failing tests first).
- **2025-11-05:** 📋 **PLA-1 HIGH-LEVEL ANALYSIS COMPLETE!** Baseline Log and Baseline Snapshot concept merge analysis completed. Analysis document created at `docs/analysis/pla_1_baseline-log-snapshot-merge-analysis.md`. Comprehensive analysis covers: current state (BaselineLog + BaselineSnapshot models with one-to-one relationship), codebase patterns (auto-creation, tabbed views, aggregation), integration touchpoints (backend models, API routes, frontend components), abstraction inventory, three alternative approaches (full merge recommended, read-only view, gradual deprecation), architectural impact assessment, risks and unknowns. **Recommendation:** Approach 1 - Full Merge (BaselineSnapshot into BaselineLog). Rationale: simplifies architecture, eliminates duplication, improves performance, consistent with codebase patterns. Estimated effort: 12-16 hours total (backend 8-10h, frontend 2-3h, testing 2-3h). Ready for detailed planning phase.
- **2025-11-04:** ✅ **E3-008 IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE!** Baseline Snapshot View UI fully implemented and integrated. All 9 phases complete: 3 backend API endpoints (snapshot summary, cost elements by WBE, cost elements list), 4 frontend components (summary cards, grouped table with collapsible WBE sections, paginated flat table, modal with tabs), and ViewBaselineSnapshot integrated into BaselineLogsTable. Modal includes 3 tabs: Summary (project-level aggregated metrics), By WBE (grouped view - default tab), All Cost Elements (paginated flat list). Manual testing successful. Completion analysis saved at `docs/completions/e3-008-baseline-snapshot-view-ui-completion.md`. Known issue: Test cleanup order in conftest.py needs fix (separate infrastructure concern).
- **2025-11-09:** ✅ **Budget Timeline EV Overlay COMPLETE!** Frontend: `frontend/src/components/Projects/BudgetTimeline.tsx` now overlays Earned Value (EV) alongside Planned Value (PV) and Actual Cost (AC) using a new `buildEarnedValueTimeline` utility for daily cumulative aggregation. Filters redesigned with Chakra `Collapsible` sections in `BudgetTimelineFilter` to conserve vertical space while keeping selection controls accessible. Playwright regression `frontend/tests/project-cost-element-tabs.spec.ts` updated with EV legend assertion and collapsible visibility checks. Documentation appended here; implementation followed TDD with new failing test first.
- **2025-11-04:** 📋 **E3-008 DETAILED PLAN COMPLETE!** Baseline Snapshot View UI detailed TDD plan created at `docs/plans/e3-008-baseline-snapshot-view-ui.plan.md`. Plan includes 9 phases: 3 backend API endpoints (snapshot summary with aggregated values, cost elements grouped by WBE, cost elements flat list with pagination), 4 frontend components (summary cards, grouped table, flat table, modal with tabs), and integration into BaselineLogsTable. Estimated 20-28 hours total. Ready for implementation starting Phase 1 (TDD: failing tests first).
- **2025-11-04:** 📋 **E3-008 & E3-009 ANALYSIS COMPLETE!** Baseline Snapshot View UI high-level analysis completed. Analysis document created at `docs/analysis/baseline-snapshot-view-ui-analysis.md`. Recommended approach: Modal dialog with tabs (Summary, By WBE, All Cost Elements) + separate API endpoints with lazy loading. Clarifications received: Max 30 baselines per project, max 50 WBEs, hierarchical user workflow (Project → WBE → Cost Elements), no export needed. New tasks added: E3-008 (Baseline Snapshot View UI) and E3-009 (Baseline Comparison). Ready for detailed planning phase.
- **2025-11-04:** 📋 **E3-005 DETAILED PLAN COMPLETE!** Baseline Log Implementation detailed TDD plan created at `docs/plans/e3-005-baseline-log-implementation.plan.md`. Plan includes 13 phases: Backend model updates (project_id, milestone_type, is_cancelled), database migration, BaselineCostElement model creation, BaselineSnapshot linking, snapshotting helper function, CRUD API endpoints (list/read/create/update/cancel), frontend components (table, add/edit/cancel modals), and project detail page tab integration. Automatic snapshotting on baseline creation includes BaselineSnapshot + BaselineCostElement records for all cost elements. Estimated 18-25 hours total. Ready for implementation starting Phase 1 (TDD: failing tests first).
- **2025-11-04:** 🔄 **E3-005 ANALYSIS COMPLETE!** Baseline Log Implementation high-level analysis completed. Analysis document created at `docs/analysis/e3-005-baseline-log-implementation-analysis.md`. Key findings: BaselineLog model exists but missing `project_id` field (migration needed). CostElementSchedule and EarnedValueEntry already have `baseline_id` ready for linking. Recommended approach: Project-scoped CRUD API following established patterns. Estimated 8-10 hours implementation. Stakeholder clarifications received: snapshotting automatic, soft delete via is_cancelled, milestone_type field required, UI in project detail tab. Ready for detailed planning phase.

Integrated AddCostElement component into WBE detail page. Follows established AddWBE/AddProject patterns. 2 new backend tests added, 13 total tests passing. Frontend client regenerated with CostElementTypesService. Full TDD implementation from RED to GREEN. Node.js upgraded to v24.11.0 for compatibility.
- **2025-11-02:** ✅ **E1-005 COMPLETE!** WBE Creation Interface implemented. Modal form following AddProject pattern with all 7 fields (machine_type required, others optional). Status dropdown with 5 options (designing, in-production, shipped, commissioning, completed). Revenue allocation validation (min >= 0). Integrated into project detail page. Navigation fix: Discovered and fixed TanStack Router nested route issue - parent routes must render `<Outlet />` for child routes to render. Typed route navigation pattern used for type safety.
- **2025-11-02:** ✅ **E1-004 COMPLETE!** Project Creation Interface implemented. Modal form with all 10 fields (required + optional). Status dropdown with 4 predefined values. Project Manager dropdown loads all active users. Full validation with React Hook Form. Toast notifications on success/error. Query invalidation refreshes projects list. Matches existing AddUser pattern perfectly.
- **2025-11-01:** ✅ **DOC-005 COMPLETE!** Development environment setup finalized. Environment scaffolded using ready-made template from FastAPI GitHub repository.

All development tools and workflows are configured and ready for use.
- **2025-11-01:** 🎉 **E1-001 COMPLETE!** Database schema implementation finished. All 19 models implemented including User/Item, lookup tables, core hierarchy (Project/WBE/CostElement), all EVM tracking models, change/quality management, and audit/compliance. 19 Alembic migrations applied successfully. 121/121 tests passing. Comprehensive test coverage with proper relationships. Clean model organization with SQLModel patterns. Foundation established for Sprint 1.
- **2024-12-19:** Technology stack selection updated to use SQLite for MVP (was PostgreSQL). Selected FastAPI + React + SQLite for initial implementation with clear migration path to PostgreSQL for production. Comprehensive selection document updated.
- **2024-12-19:** Technology stack selection completed (DOC-004). Selected FastAPI + React + SQLite (MVP). Comprehensive selection document created with rationale, architecture diagrams, and detailed component specifications.
- **2024-12-19:** Updated PRD and data model with Planned Value and Earned Value calculation requirements. Added Baseline Log table to replace boolean baseline flags with proper baseline_id references. All documentation is now complete and aligned.

### Design Decisions

- Technology stack: FastAPI (backend), React + TypeScript (frontend), PostgreSQL database
- **Model implementation approach:** Model-first with auto-generated Alembic migrations, using SQLModel throughout
- **TDD discipline:** Comprehensive test suite with 66 model tests covering relationships, validation, and schemas
- **Code organization:** Clean separation - 1 file per model with Base/Create/Update/Public schema pattern
- Baseline tracking uses centralized Baseline Log table instead of scattered boolean flags
- Planned Value calculation uses Cost Element Schedule with progression types (linear, gaussian, logarithmic)
- Earned Value calculation uses baselined percentage of work completed
- All baseline references use baseline_id for proper audit trail and historical tracking
- UUID primary keys throughout for scalability
- Comprehensive foreign key relationships with cascade deletes where appropriate

### Next Steps

1. **Immediate:** ✅ **Sprint 2 COMPLETE!** All Sprint 2 tasks implemented (E2-001, E2-002, E2-003, E2-005, E2-006) with E2-004 skipped for later
2. **Short-term:** Begin Sprint 3 tasks (Cost Registration, Cost History, Earned Value Recording)
3. **Medium-term:** Complete Sprint 3 and proceed to Sprint 4 (EVM Calculations)
